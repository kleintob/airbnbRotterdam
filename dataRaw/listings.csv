Sinds 2015 ben ik trotse eigenares van dit stadsappartement op de perfecte locatie!
Met mijn partner en baby samen ga ik binnenkort verhuizen naar een buitenwijk van Rotterdam omdat dit mooie stadsappartement gewoonweg te klein is om met z'n 3en in te blijven wonen.
Omdat ik in het verleden jarenlang dit appartement heb verhuurd via o.a. Airbnb, wil ik dat nu opnieuw doen voor een tijdje.
Dit keer is mijn gehele appartement beschikbaar via Airbnb, voorheen woonde ik er zelf ook en tegelijkertijd verhuurde ik een kamer voor 2 personen.

Ik woon, werk en studeer(de) in Rotterdam.
Sinds 2015 werk ik als zelfstandig Recruiter, Relatiemanager en Sollicitatiecoach.
Wat ik erg leuk vind aan mijn werk is het dagelijks schakelen met een diversiteit aan mensen en nationaliteiten op verschillende niveaus.

Naast dat er veel tijd gaat naar mijn lieve baby (dreumes alweer), besteed ik graag tijd aan surfen, mijn familie en vrienden, muziek volleybal, hardlopen en nieuwe plekken ontdekken.
Mijn favoriete muziek is Reggae; ik kan geen dag zonder!

Voor mij is deze plek de ideale plek van wonen; midden in het centrum, alles op loop- en fietsafstand. Ik ervaar hier het ultieme stadsgevoel met nog een beetje groen om mij heen!
Mijn appartement bevindt zich op de topetage waardoor je de hele dag kunt genieten van een mooi uitzicht.

Als ik thuis ben en mijn koffie drink kijk ik graag naar de vrachtschepen die voorbij varen. Dit geeft mij het gevoel in een havenstad te wonen.
Ik maak graag wandelingen door de stad en drink mijn biertje in toeristisch Delfshaven wat 5 min lopen van mijn huis ligt. 
Hier ligt veel geschiedenis van de stad. Vanuit deze plek is Rotterdam min of meer uitgebouwd. Het is daar rustig en mooi. Het lijkt een beetje op Amsterdam met zijn grachten en pakhuiswoningen.

Ik ben een creatief persoon en ben graag fysiek bezig.
In mijn B&B zul je de sfeer van creativiteit kunnen proeven.
De inrichting van heel mijn huis heb ik in de stijl van het huis wat in 1924 gebouwd is. Bovendien is het een bewuste keuze om te recycelen.

Naast mijn benb vind ik het heerlijk om in mijn tuin te tuinieren.  Ik schilder graag en maak tassen. 
Ik help anderen hun huis te reorganiseren en opknappen.
Dus u zou mij in kluskleding aan kunnen treffen ;-)

Sinds kort bezit ik een camperbusje. Ik ben daar erg blij mee en ga graag naar natuulijke campings waar het vaak mooi, rustig en vriendelijk is. Bovendien is daar qua natuur veel te beleven.

Thank you for reading this before you made a booking request. Airbnb has changed a lot since they started, they became a lot bigger with an estimated 2,6 billion in revenue this year.

I am an apartment owner that has put love and attention into my place so it is a nice place to live in. I am sharing that experience with like minded strangers. The motivational factor is ofcourse the money but in the end this should hopefully not be a merely financial transaction.

An unique space in the heart of Rotterdam . You'll be staying in my 75m2 apartment on the ground floor, including spacious modern kitchen and living room, 2 bedrooms (1x king-size bed, 1x childbed with slide ;) and a bathroom with bath and shower, sunny balcony and 50m2 garden on the south-west. And oh: my worm bin (yes, do my own composting ;).","The apartment is based in the hart of the city on the Noordereiland, an island that lies between the Meuse, right between the three iconic Rotterdam bridges. From the window you can see the river and the big white bridge (Erasmus bridge). <br /><br />The neighbourhood is a very laid back place in a city that is vibrant and urban, with very nice people (so are my neighbours :). There is little car traffic as people hardly pass the island itself to get somewhere. There is a small Spar supermarket, two coffee and lunchrooms, a pop-up restaurant and several kids playgrounds  in the middle of the island.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6NDk2MzI1NTc%3D/original/9faacce2-945a-498c-94c3-fc4f40dc314e.jpeg,15209726,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/15209726,Sabine,2014-05-07,"Rotterdam, Netherlands","My name is Sabine. I am an entrepreneurial anthropologist, living & working in Rotterdam.  I started my own company in 2015: BlueCity: based in a former swimmingpool in Rotterdam (Tropicana). Its core business involves sustainability and showing what we can do with waste :-)...
And my little son Jan and I have created our own paradise in the city! 

My interests are social entrepreneurship, social innovation, surfing, circle economy, systemic thinking, more, more and ever more sports and (online) large scale interventions & sustainability.

The world is my number one country :-!  But aside from all that, I love to learn! About you, about the world and about your world!
So hope to meet you soon :-)!

Welcome at my page!:)
My name is Mirjam, I'm a Dutchie, in daily life I'm a social worker. In my spare time I love to visit new places, nature, singing, a sucker for good coffee,  going out for walks,  try to play guitar ( with the emphasis on 'try'), do my best to give some love to my plants, like to cook and ofcourse... traveling!

Since I was young I already liked traveling.  I remember my family and I were traveling by campervan. Such a joy we had. I continued traveling when I got older. I've been to countries within Europe, but also outside Europe, like: the US, Indonesia, South Africa, Brazil, Curacaõ, Laoh and Thailand.  I've stayed more than a year in Thailand where I've worked on voluntary base as a counselor. 

When I travel I would like to have that feeling of 'home'. That's why I  love to host and to give my guests that feeling of 'home' as well. 

That feeling of traveling and meeting new people, makes me come alive. 
So why not meeting new people, travelers, in my city Rotterdam?

I hope to get to know you a bit as well:)

I am Joost, I live in Rotterdam and I love to travel and explore the world for work as for pleasure. That's why I can sometimes rent out my cosy apartment in the centre of Rotterdam. Throughout my travelling career I have always used Rotterdam as my base. This is the city where I grew up, studied and most of my family & friends live whom I meet up with for dinner & drinks in the weekend. I hope you will enjoy Rotterdam as much I do. The city has a great vibe with lots of contemporary architectonical buildings and cool bars. In the street of my apartment are many bars and restaurants to be found. I hope you will enjoy yourself. 

Cheers,
Joost

Prepare yourself for an unforgettable overnight stay in our atmospheric ART-INN residence in Delfshaven where art and living come together. With its centuries-old canals, picturesque facades, and winding streets, Delfshaven breathes a unique atmosphere that will keep you captivated right away.","Located in the west of Rotterdam, Delfshaven is a charming neighborhood steeped in history and maritime atmosphere. The neighborhood was born in the 14th century as an independent city, but was later in the 19th century annexed by Rotterdam. Despite the growth of the modern city, Delfshaven has managed to maintain its historical character.<br /><br />An important moment in the history of Delfshaven was the pilgrimage of the Mayflower in 1620. The starting point of this famous trip to America was not Plymouth in England, but Delfshaven. A memorial monument, called the Pilgrim Fathers Church, marks this historical event.<br /><br />One of the most striking sights in Delfshaven is the Old or Pilgrim Fathers Church, built in the 15th century. This Gothic church has a rich history and houses the tomb of the famous pilgrim father, Reverend John Robinson.
