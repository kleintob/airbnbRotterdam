# airbnbRotterdam
 
This repository was created while teaching the course Econometrics for ECO at Tilburg University.

It contains the 25 June, 2024 data for Airbnb listings from https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/.

The raw data are in the directory `dataRaw`.

In `dataCreated`, we create an RData file with cleaned data. This is done using `buildDataset.Rmd`.

Various analyses are conducted using R. The code for this is in the folder `analysis`. It uses data from `dataCreated`.
